## Project Overview:
This project involves the analysis of hotel sales data from multiple branches and cities to derive meaningful business insights. The dataset contains over 500,000 transaction records and focuses on identifying sales trends, customer preferences, popular ordering platforms, and the impact of discounts. The objective is to enable data-driven decision-making to enhance operational efficiency and drive revenue growth.

## Dataset Overview: 

This dataset contains sales transaction data from a hotel business. After cleaning, the key fields used in the analysis are:

Branch_Name – Name of the branch

Business_Date – Date of the transaction

Invoice_Time – Time of the invoice

Invoice_Number – Unique invoice identifier

Order_Source – Source of order (e.g., dine-in, online)

Sale_Item_Qty – Quantity of items sold

Gross_Amount – Gross sales amount before discounts

Discounts – Total discounts applied

Category – Food or service category

Payment_Modes – Mode of payment (cash, card, etc.)

City – City where the transaction took place

Day – Day of the week



## Data Preparation & Acquisition:

Raw data included over 5 lakh rows from hotel branches.

Cleaned using Excel to remove nulls, filter required columns, and normalize categorical data.

Columns were renamed for clarity (e.g., Gross_Amount, Payment_Modes, Order_Source).

Calculated new fields such as day of the week from transaction dates.

## Research Problem Statement:
"How can the hotel business optimize its branch performance, pricing, and promotions based on historical sales data, customer preferences, and payment behavior?"

This project aims to answer:

Which city and category generate the most revenue?

Which payment modes and platforms are most effective?

How do discounts affect branch-level revenue?

What days are peak and off-peak for sales?

## Project Goals:
Understand sales performance across branches and cities.

Identify the most profitable categories and busiest days.

Analyze customer behavior by payment modes and order platforms.

Track the impact of discounts on overall revenue.

Present insights through a visual dashboard for stakeholders.

## Key Analysis Areas:
## 1.Performance Metrics

 Total Gross Revenue: ₹142M

 Total Discounts Given: ₹-276M

 Total Items Sold: 593K

## 2.Visual Insights
Total Sales by Day Across Cities
Bangalore consistently generates higher sales than Chennai.

Weekends show peak sales.

## 3.Revenue by City

Bangalore accounts for nearly 60% of total revenue.

Revenue by Order Source

Zomato and Swiggy contribute the most.


## 4.Items Sold by Payment Mode

Swiggy and Zomato (app-based payments) dominate.

Traditional payment methods like cash and card are least used.

Category-wise Gross Amount

Top-selling categories: Biryani, Beverages, Starters.


## Conclusion & Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, weekend sales are the highest, so branches should increase staff and inventory during peak days. Zomato and Swiggy generate major revenue, so partnering closely with them can further boost orders. Additionally, discounts should be strategically offered only at underperforming branches to attract more customers while minimizing overall revenue loss.
